      <p>The <i>Wilde Trials International News Archive</i> gathers together for the first time
        international news reports on the famous three trials of Oscar Wilde. These trials took
        place in London over the course of April and May 1895.</p>
      <p>Wilde initiated the first trial when he sued the Marquis of Queensberry for criminal libel
        after the man left him a calling card that read “For Oscar Wilde posing Somdomite.” Wilde
        lost his case, with devastating consequences.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on charges of “gross indecency” under Section 11 of the Criminal Law
        Amendment Act of 1885 and subsequently endured two further criminal trials. Although the
        first trial resulted in a hung jury, the second concluded with his conviction. Sentenced to
        two years of prison with hard labour, he lost everything: freedom, fame, family, and
        fortune.</p>
      <p>All three trials were a global media event, reported by journalists interested not only in
        the courtroom proceedings, but also in the sensational stories that unfolded around them --
        including a Piccadilly street fight and a French duel. </p>
      <p>The trials also triggered important debates about gender expression and sexuality, family
        relations, press standards, and the principle of art for art’s sake.</p>
      <p>Currently the archive includes almost 2,000 separate news reports (amounting to 1,062,802 words),
        collected from newspapers from nineteen different countries and in four languages. </p>
      <p>As the first collection of international news reports on the Wilde trials, the <i>Wilde Trials
        International News Archive</i> offers a number of new opportunities for reading the news as it spread across borders and
        languages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can read the reports in their original language, or in English translation.</li>
  <li>You can browse through one newspaper’s entire coverage, or search by keyword all the coverage collected in the archive.</li>
  <li>You can compare one report to another, using the archive’s text-comparison tools to retrace
        how news was copied and transformed as it travelled via news services and telegraph wires
        around the world.</li>
    <li> You can also find patterns in the data, downloading a range of bibliographic and textual
      data generated from the archive.</li>
</ul>
      <p>However you explore the <i>Wilde Trials International News Archive</i>, you are invited to
        understand anew a watershed event in the history of gender, sexuality, and journalism.</p>
